synchronous operation: A synchronous operation blocks other operations from executing until it completes.
synchronous function: A synchronous function only performs synchronous operations.
asynchronous operation: Once initiated, an asynchronous operation allows other operations to execute 
before it completes.
asynchronous function: An asynchronous function performs at least one asynchronous operation and 
can also perform synchronous operations.

await: You can use the await keyword to get the completed result of
 an asynchronous expression. The await keyword only works within an async function.
