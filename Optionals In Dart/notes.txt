--> Optionality in dart is the ability to have a value or have not a value.
--> using "?" with declaration of variable show this may contain value or may not contain.
--> ability of a variable to contain value for that data type or not contain value for that data type.
--> datatype + ? --> adds optionality to the variable that it can be null or contain value
--> when we do not specify data type and set it to null then data type will be automatically dynamic.
--> when we are working with normal declaration of a variable, it should be initialized with some 
--> value necessarily but when working with optional variables then they are by default set to null
--> we do not necessarily need to assign them value.
--> "??=" assign value to a variable only if it is null otherwise not
--> Nullable or optioal variables 
--> Container data types like lists can be itself nullable and can also contain data types nullable
CONDITIONAL MEMBER ACCESS OPERATOR::
--> "?." -> access the property only if value if not null otherwise skip property and return null
--> There is also static analyzer in dart
